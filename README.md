# RESTFUL-Blog-App

A project that culminates all of the things I learned about the Front-End working with the Back-end of a web application. This project is a Simple Blog App that allows a user to create, edit, and delete blog posts that contain a title, link for an image, and a description. Follows REST pattern by containing RESTful routes. Connected to a database and follows CRUD operations.
